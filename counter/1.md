Welcome to the counter!
=======================

Add a new file with the next (or previous. decimals are ok, random extensions are ok, no fractions or other expressions) number that is needed to be added.
All files (except this one) should have a size quota of 2kb max.
Failure to meet that quota means that your change will not get merged.

So, to recap:

1. File needs to be a number, can be a decimal.

2. Please add files in order, don't fill in decimals between numbers.

3. Files have to be less than 2kb, except this one.

4. Files can have a random extension, or no extension at all.

5. Extensions are defined as [your number].[whatever the hell you want]

6. Same rules apply that are in the README.md inside the project root.

7. You are allowed to come back and edit other numbers, just don't rename the files.

Anyways, Good Luck and HAVE FUN!
